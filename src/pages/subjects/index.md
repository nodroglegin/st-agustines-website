      heading: Logic I
      text: >
        Are there “laws of thought” just as surely as there is a law of gravity?
        The answer is a resounding “yes!” In this course we will learn how to
        reason in an orderly and consistent fashion. Students will master the
        rules that govern the thinking process. There will be a particular
        emphasis on applying these rules to the field of Christian apologetics.
        The goal is to know better how to love God with all our minds. Students
        will study forms of correct thinking, using traditional Aristotelian
        tools such as formal proofs and truth tables. Students will also become
        familiar with the common logical fallacies to avoid.

      heading: Rhetoric I
      text: >
        Rhetoric I introduces students to the concepts and practical principles
        of the ancient art of rhetoric, the third part of the classical Trivium.
        Drawn largely from Aristotle’s Rhetoric and Quintilian’s Institutio
        Oratoria, the course trains students in using and applying the classical
        rhetorical canons to a variety of spoken and written assignments. In
        particular, students will learn how to think rhetorically as both
        producers and critics of persuasive communication, guided by knowledge
        of the rhetorical process, kairos and stasis theory, the common topics,
        and proofs.  Students will also continue to develop their skill in
        constructing well-organized essays and speeches, advancing their range
        of stylistic expression, preparation and delivery. Underlying this
        course is the assumption that excellent speech and writing is part of
        what brings glory to God and part of what brings us to enjoy Him.

      heading: Academic Writing
      text: >
        This introduction to Academic Writing focuses on formal academic writing
        for high school students new to composition or needing more confidence
        and practice. Students practice the trajectory of the writing process
        from prewriting, drafting, revising, and editing to final submission by
        mastering the skills of the first three canons of rhetoric: invention,
        arrangement, and elocution. Not only do students gain greater
        proficiency in the art of writing well-crafted sentences, coherent
        paragraphs, and well-structured analytical and argumentative essays,
        they also practice strategic reading, summarizing, paraphrasing, and
        embedding quotes. In addition, they learn to properly document both
        print and online sources using correct referencing. Students use both
        fiction and non-fiction sources to practice core reading strategies.
        These sources also provide the content for student writing assignments.

      heading: Latin I
      text: >
        Latin is alive and lively in Latin 1 with the renowned Cambridge Latin
        programme! Students will explore how an inflected language works by
        studying five noun declensions, four verb conjugations, adjectives,
        pronouns, and common expressions. Emphasis is given to Latin vocabulary
        and English derivatives. Students will build translation skills while
        exploring Roman culture and studying people and practices from antiquity
        by reading passages in both Latin and English, which are further brought
        to life by the teacher. Students will be encouraged to see elements of
        Latin and Roman civilization throughout the world today, inspiring them
        to integrate Latin with their literature and history lessons.

  heading: The Great Conversation
  description: >+
    The overall purpose of the course is to introduce students to the Great
    Conversation of Western Civilisation. By reading and discussing the key
    works of the past several thousand years it is our hope that your students
    will be better informed to live wise and purposeful lives from a Christian
    perspective. In addition to developing thinking and leadership skills
    students will typically improve their vocabulary, presentation and writing
    expertise. Thus the course suits many middle school aged children who are
    looking to improve their understanding of logic as well as literacy skills.
    St Augustine’s tutors will select both Primary and Secondary Books from the
    Veritas curriculum, choosing the most popular classics to make the course
    more accessible to a new generation of potential classics students.

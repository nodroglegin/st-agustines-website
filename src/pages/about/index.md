### Australian Classical Christian Education
St Augustine's Classical Christian College was founded in 2008, with the vision of introducing classical Christian education to Australia. The College is an affiliate of the Association of Classical and Christian Schools (ACCS) in the United States (www.accsedu.org).

Internationally, classical Christian education is experiencing increasing success in response to the 'dumbing down' of Western education. 

With St Augustine's Classical Christian College the first such institution in Australia, its establishment represents a significant opportunity for Australians to take advantage of a new stream of independent education. 

### Why Classical Christian Education
Classical Christian education is not a new philosophy. Instead, its aim is to 'rediscover the lost tools of learning' in the words of Dorothy Sayers and to restore education to its past standard of excellence. 

In constrast to most of the current trends in education, classical Christian education uses the time-tested Trivium teaching methodology, which naturally appeals to students as they develop through the three stages of learning: grammar phase, logic phase and rhetoric phase.


#### Grammar phase
Young children (up to year 6) thrive on memorisation and are good at it! Teaching methods include chants and drills, songs, jingles and verse. During this phase children can use and develop these memorisation skills to learn an enormous amount of information. Classical education engages minds and inspires students to investigate, contemplate and pursue knowledge.

#### Logic phase
Early adolescents (year 7-9) start to develop the ability to link and draw conclusions from a series of fact, and want to know 'why?'.

Formal logic, logical fallacies and reasoning skills are introduced at this stage of the Trivium using tools like the Socratic Method and Aristotelian logic. 

#### Rhetoric phase
Upper high school (year 10-12) students become increasingly self-aware and concerned with how others perceive them and how their peers think. They want to formulate and express their own ideas, and are idealistic and interested in Justice and Truth. 

Students at this level of the classical Trivium are taught how to speak and write well, and communicate effectively with clarity and lucidity. 

There is an emphasis on Christian wisdom and character development in Classical education not just on teaching facts and skills. 

Students cultivate an interest in first principles and truth, an appreciation of beauty and a standard of excellence. Classical education involves understanding the present by learning about the past through History, Philosophy, Theology, Literature, Arts, Latin, Greek, Logic and Rhetoric.
